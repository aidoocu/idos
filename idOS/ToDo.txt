/** 

If an unexpected interrupt occurs (interrupt is enabled and no handler is installed, which usually indicates a bug), then the default action is to reset the device by jumping to the reset vector. You can override this by supplying a function named BADISR_vect which should be defined with ISR() as such. (The name BADISR_vect is actually an alias for __vector_default. The latter must be used inside assembly code in case <avr/interrupt.h> is not included.)

#include <avr/interrupt.h>
ISR(BADISR_vect)
{
    // user code here
}
